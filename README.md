# Components created

1. Movies: component with all the logic where I import data (form fakeMovieService.js file) to pass into MovieTable, Pagination and ListGroup components
2. MovieTable: Component to show into a table all movies
3. ListGroup: Component to show all genres and use this menu to filter the results to show in MovieTable
4. Pagination: Component to allow to create pages and show only max 4 movies into every one
5. Like Component used in MovieTable to allow you to add a like to a specific movie
